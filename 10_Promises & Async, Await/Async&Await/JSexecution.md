### Overview of javascript Execution

JavaScript operates as a single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronous, concurrent programming language. Hereâ€™s how each part of that description plays into synchronous and asynchronous behavior:

1.  **Single-Threaded:** JavaScript executes code in a single sequence, meaning only one piece of code runs at a time.
2.  **Non-Blocking:** JavaScript can handle tasks without waiting for one task to complete before starting another. This is achieved through asynchronous programming.
3.  **Asynchronous:** Allows certain operations, like network requests, to happen independently of the main thread, so the rest of the code can continue executing.
4.  **Concurrent:** Can handle multiple tasks seemingly at once by managing execution with non-blocking behavior.

### Synchronous JavaScript

*   **Function Execution Stack (Call Stack):** When a function is called, it is added to the call stack. The stack keeps track of the current function and its calls. Functions execute in a last-in, first-out order.
*   **Example:**

```javascript
Copy code
function f1() { console.log('f1'); }
function f2() { console.log('f2'); }
function f3() { console.log('f3'); }

f1(); // Logs 'f1'
f2(); // Logs 'f2'
f3(); // Logs 'f3'
```
*   Here, `f1`, `f2`, and `f3` execute one after the other in sequence.

### Asynchronous JavaScript

*   **Browser APIs/Web APIs:** Functions like `setTimeout`, `fetch`, and event handlers manage asynchronous operations. They use callback functions to handle the results of asynchronous tasks.
*   **Example with** `**setTimeout**`**:**

```javascript
Copy code
function printMe() { console.log('print me'); }
setTimeout(printMe, 2000); // Executes printMe after 2 seconds
console.log('This line runs first');

```
*   Output:

arduino
Copy code
This line runs first
print me

*   **Callback Queue:** When an asynchronous task completes, its callback is placed in the callback queue. The event loop periodically checks this queue and executes callbacks when the call stack is empty.
*   **Event Loop:** Manages the call stack and the callback queue. It ensures that callbacks from the callback queue are executed only when the call stack is clear.
*   **Example:**

```javascript
Copy code
function f1() { console.log('f1'); }
function f2() { console.log('f2'); }
function main() {
  setTimeout(f1, 0);
  f2();
}
main();
```
*   Output:

>Copy code
f2
f1

*   Despite `f1` being scheduled with zero delay, `f2` runs first because the callback queue is processed after the call stack is empty.

### Promises and Job Queue

*   **Promises:** Represent asynchronous operations. They have three states: pending, fulfilled, and rejected. When a promise is fulfilled or rejected, its `then` or `catch` handlers are executed.
*   **Example:**

```javascript
Copy code
const promise = new Promise((resolve) => {
  resolve('Resolved');
});
promise.then(result => console.log(result));
```
*   Output:

Copy code
Resolved

*   **Job Queue (Microtask Queue):** Handles promises and has higher priority than the callback queue. Promises are placed in the job queue and executed before any callback from the callback queue.
*   **Example:**

```javascript
Copy code
function main() {
  setTimeout(() => console.log('timeout'), 0);
  Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log('promise'));
}
main();
```
*   Output:

arduino
Copy code
promise
timeout

*   The promise handler runs before the `setTimeout` callback because the job queue has higher priority over the callback queue.

### Summary

1.  **Synchronous Execution:** Code runs line by line, managed by the call stack.
2.  **Asynchronous Execution:** Managed by browser APIs and involves a callback queue and event loop.
3.  **Promises and Job Queue:** Promises use the job queue for handling async results, giving them priority over callback functions.

This distinction helps understand how JavaScript handles operations that involve waiting or concurrency while maintaining a single-threaded execution model.
