# Classes In JavaScript.

> In object-oriented programming, a class is an extensible program-code-template for creating objects, providing initial values for state (member variables) and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).

### Understanding JavaScript Classes

JavaScript has evolved significantly over the years, and one of the most impactful features introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) is the `class` syntax. JavaScript classes provide a much cleaner and more intuitive way to create objects and handle inheritance.

## What Are JavaScript Classes?

In JavaScript, classes are essentially syntactic sugar over the existing prototype-based inheritance. While the class syntax looks and behaves more like classes in traditional object-oriented languages (like Java or C++), it's important to understand that they don't introduce a new object-oriented inheritance model in JavaScript.

## Basic Syntax

 ```code
 class MyClass {
  // class methods
  constructor() { ... }
  method1() { ... }
  method2() { ... }
  method3() { ... }
  ...
}
```



The `class` keyword is used to define a class. A simple example of a class in JavaScript would look like this:

```javascript
class Animal {
  constructor(name, type) {
    this.name = name;
    this.type = type;
  }

  describe() {
    return `${this.name} is a ${this.type}.`;
  }
}

const dog = new Animal('Buddy', 'Dog');
console.log(dog.describe()); // Buddy is a Dog.
```
