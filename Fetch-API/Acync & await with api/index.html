        Promises are objects in JavaScript that represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. They are commonly used for handling asynchronous operations such as fetching data from an API. You can learn more about promises in JavaScript from the MDN Promise documentation.
        
       <p>
         Async functions are functions in JavaScript that allow you to write asynchronous code in a synchronous manner. When you declare a function as async, it automatically returns a promise. Within an async function, you can use the await keyword to pause the execution of the function until a promise is settled (resolved or rejected). This makes it easier to work with promises and handle asynchronous operations. You can find more information about async functions in the MDN async function documentation.
      </p>

        Await is used inside async functions to wait for a promise to be settled. When you use await before a promise, the function will pause at that line until the promise is resolved, and then it will continue executing the code. This helps in writing asynchronous code that looks synchronous and is easier to read and maintain. You can read more about the await keyword in the MDN await documentation.

        When working with APIs, you can use promises, async functions, and await to fetch data asynchronously. Here's a basic example of how you can use them to fetch data from an API:
        
      </p>
      <h2>
        JAVASCRIPT
      </h2>
        
        <h3>
          Queue <br>
          Play
        </h3>
        <code>
           async function fetchData() {
             try {
               const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
            if (!response.ok) {
              throw new Error('Failed to fetch data');
            }
            const data = await response.json();
            console.log(data);
          } catch (error) {
            console.error(error);
          }
        }
        
        fetchData();
      </code>
      
      <p>

        In this example:
        
        The fetchData function is declared as async, making it an async function that returns a promise.
        Inside the function, await fetch('https://api.example.com/data') is used to fetch data from the API. The function pauses at this line until the data is fetched.
        If the response is not successful (status code other than 200), an error is thrown.
        If the response is successful, the data is extracted using response.json() and logged to the console.
        Any errors that occur during the process are caught and logged to the console.
        This is a basic example to demonstrate how promises, async functions, and await can be used to fetch data from an API asynchronously in JavaScript.
